This repository is aimed at containing documents that can help in
events such as cryptoparties. For instance:
- memos with where to download appropriate software and how to use
  some core functionalities (e.g. fingerprint checking);
- slides meant at explaining things in a simple way for beginners.

Later on, this repo will have a structure that will ease translation
of the content into as many languages as possible.

It is deliberate that some documents show URLs in a non-link format,
because we want them to be displayed when printed from a PDF.
