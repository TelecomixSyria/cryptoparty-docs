_Mumble_ allows voice conversations by connecting to a server and talking to people that are connected to the same server. The voice stream is encrypted with TLS. It is mostly designed for talking to multiple people at the same time but can be used for one-to-one conversations. It is not equivalent to Skype feature-wise, does not work on a "call" base but is free and open-source, simple to setup and can be a relevant replacement.
