Similarly to websites, only your contacts who use PGP will have a PGP fingerprint that you can check.

In **Thunderbird** with **Enigmail**:

- to see the list of all fingerprints you have:
    1. Click on the OpenPGP menu
    2. Click on the "Key management" item
    3. Right-click on a key in the list and select "Key properties" at the bottom of the menu (use the "Sign key" menu entry to sign it when you have verified fingerprints)
- to see the fingerprint when receiving an email:
    1. Click on the email
    2. In the colored bar on the top of the email content, click on "Details"
    3. In the drop-down menu, select "Key properties"
