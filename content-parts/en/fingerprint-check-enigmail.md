In **Thunderbird** with **Enigmail**:

- to see the list of all fingerprints you have:
    1. Click on the OpenPGP menu
    2. Click on the "Key management" item
    3. Select any key from the list to check the fingerprint
- to see the fingerprint when receiving an email:
    1. Click on the email
    2. In the colored bar on the top of the email content, click on "Details"
    3. In the drop-down menu, select "Key properties"
